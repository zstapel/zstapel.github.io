	<h1>Theaster Gates</h1>
	<p>Gates is a Chicago born artist who works with archival art and abandoned spaces. His father was a roofer, and growing up Gates did not have the same art resources that others had. He had tar instead, he used it as a material in some of his starting works. He then became interested in abandoned buildings within his neighborhood. Growing up he would see these spaces that were left empty, given up upon and then the city would bulldoze. He did not like that removal and saught to transform these abandoned spaces into something for the community. Through this, his work branced to archival art for the community. He gathered magazines and art collections significant to the black community, some which honored them and some which were created to degrade them, but all important to history. </p>
	<p> These websites following are all abondoned, or almost abandoned, from people moving to newer platforms leaving behind the past. Simular to how Gates takes over these physical spaces in his community, I am archiving some of his older works within these abandoned spaces. In that sense Gates is rejuvinating both the physical and virtual world. Because Gates also works with archival work, only his past work is featured. Though I cannot include all of his projects you will see some of the most significant projects he has achived posted on these sites. </p>
